# HaiDianPangDuDu
This is a **code repository for an internet interactive game** (created in 2021.09), which includes all the code and design documents for our project as well as an introductory video.

At the same time, we have also written a **comprehensive beginner-level tutorial for HTML and CSS**, each including a document, accompanying demonstration code, and exercises, which can be used for beginners to learn.

To run and play the game, please follow the instructions below.

1. Download the Code base.
2. Click on the shortcut in the main directory.

Please notice that all the temp data are on your own computer instead of remote server.
